## Trivium Cipher: Summary
Trivium is a lightweight stream cipher designed for efficiency in hardware and software. It was proposed as part of the eSTREAM project in 2005 by Christophe De Canniere and Bart Preneel. Trivium is known for its simplicity, speed, and low memory usage.

### Key Features of Trivium:

Key Size: 80-bit
IV Size: 80-bit
State Size: 288 bits
Structure: Uses three nonlinear feedback shift registers (LFSR-like structures)
Encryption: XOR-based keystream generation
Security: No known attacks better than brute force
Trivium is widely used in lightweight cryptographic applications, including embedded systems and IoT devices.

## NIST Test Suite for Randomness
The NIST Statistical Test Suite (STS) is a collection of tests designed to evaluate the randomness of binary sequences, typically used for cryptographic applications.
